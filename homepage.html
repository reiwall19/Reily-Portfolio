            <p>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-door-open"></i><br>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Reily, and I am going to tell you a bit about myself. 
                I am 19 years old, and for the past 10 years I've been training in a martial art known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. 
                I live with my mom and step-dad, in Nova Scotia, Canada. I am currently enrolled in the IT Systems 
                Management and Security Program at the NSCC Truro Campus. I don't really know what it is I want to do when 
                I graduate, so I am hoping this gives me a good step ahead. I have a few hobbies, but my top 3 are as follows, but 
                not limited to; Weightlifting, Video games and an unhealthy obession with motorcycles and cars. The following page
                will be all my credentials and qualifications! Now for my in depth explanation. Feel free to skip ahead as I don't 
                get to talk about myself all that often, so I am taking the opportunity to rant.<br><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell"></i><br>I am quite the introvert, I spend my time doing school work, exercising or fantasising about motorcycles and cars.
                My friend group consists of multiple different groups. I have my gym group and my group from childhood. My gym group has
                my buddies; Kyler, Gabe, Kaleb and Shaye. I'm pretty sure I see these people more than I see my own family... I see them everyday.
                I am at my happiest when I'm at the gym, surrounded by these people. They're great people, as they encourage you to work hard and 
                fight for your goals. Funniest thing is I've only known a few of them for 6 months. Yet, they're still some of the best people I have 
                ever had the pleasure of meeting. My childhood friendgroup is a bit more laid-back and tame, which sometimes is all you need!<br><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-motorcycle"></i><br>My unhealthy obession with bikes and cars started as far back as I can remember. My dad had a 1200cc Ninja and it made me immediately 
                fall in love with bikes. If I had to choose one or the other, it would immediately, IN A HEARTBEAT, be a bike. He took me on his bike 
                a few times and ever since then, I've just adored the adrenaline and feeling of going fast. It's something I chase after every time I 
                drive my car, but it's not the same. Once I begin working, my first big purchase is going to be a bike. Unwise choice? Probably. I like 
                to live by one rule! I'm here for a good time, no one said anything about a long time!<br><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-gamepad"></i><br>Video games!! Oh goodness, I could go on and on about my relationship with video games. My dad got me into games when I was quite young, 
                beginning with Halo 2 and very quickly moved on to kicking my uncle's butt at Call of Duty: Black Ops. From there, it just became a hobby 
                I would find very difficult to drop. To this day I still play games as a way to take my mind off of things and a favourite pass time of mine.<br><br>
